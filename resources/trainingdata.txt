"negative","frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music ."
"negative","places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller ."
"negative","stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type ."

"negative","what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about ."
"negative","while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that ."
"negative","yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ?"

"negative","liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase ."
"negative",". . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs ."
"negative","the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball ."

"negative","the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing ."
"negative","the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel ."
"negative","once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care ."
"negative","there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought ."
"negative","it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less ."
"negative","the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover ."
